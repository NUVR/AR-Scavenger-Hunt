# AR Scavenger Hunt

A project to build augmented reality scavenger hunts

## Running
- Set up Git Large File Storage for the GLTF files
  - https://git-lfs.github.com/
  - Follow the instuctions here and make sure that you configure it as instructed via their documentation.
  - Check that your gltf files are not just pointers to git lfs but are actually there by opening the files. If they are still pointers, look through the lfs docs again. 

- `yarn install` to fetch dependencies
- `yarn start` to launch the webpack dev server on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
